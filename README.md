## General Information

- This project focuses on understanding and analyzing loan default risks using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- The background of the project involves a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The company needs to identify risky applicants to minimize financial loss due to loan defaults.
- The business problem being addressed is identifying patterns that indicate a borrower's likelihood to default on a loan. This helps in making informed decisions on loan approvals.
- The dataset used in this project contains information on past loan applicants and their repayment status, which includes fields such as loan amount, interest rate, loan status, employment length, and more.

## Conclusions

- Loan grades E and F are more likely to default compared to grades A, B, and C.
- 60-month term loans are more likely to default compared to 36-month term loans.
- Maximum loans are in the range of Rs.2500-Rs.5000, which doesn't significantly impact the likelihood of default.
- Most monthly installments are in the range of Rs.100-Rs.200, with no direct impact on default rates.
- Loans with an interest rate greater than 11% are more likely to default, especially those with rates above 14%.
- 15% of loans are charged off, amounting to a significant financial loss.
- Employment length and the number of past delinquencies do not show a significant impact on loan default.
