## General Information

- The goal of this project is to identify and analyze loan default risks via Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- The project's basis includes a consumer finance organization that specializes in providing various forms of loans to urban clients. To reduce financial losses caused by loan defaults, the organization must identify hazardous candidates.
- The business challenge being solved is recognizing patterns that signal a borrower's chance of defaulting on a loan. This allows for more informed choices on loan applications.
- The dataset utilized in this research comprises information on previous loan applicants and their repayment status, including loan amount, interest rate, loan status, length of employment, and other details.

## Conclusions

- Loan grades E and F are more likely to default than grades A, B, and C.
- 60-month term loans have a higher default rate than 36-month term loans.
- The maximum loan amount is between Rs.2500-Rs.5000, which has little influence on the chance of default.
- Most monthly installments range from Rs.100 to Rs.200, with little direct influence on default rates.
- Loans with interest rates greater than 11% are more likely to default, particularly those with rates higher than 14%.
- 15 percent of loans are charged off, resulting in a huge financial loss.
- Employment length and the number of previous delinquencies have no significant effect on loan default.
